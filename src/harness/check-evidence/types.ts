// Check Evidence Contract — types.
//
// One evidence record per registered check id, derived from live sources
// (CHECK_REGISTRY + the filesystem), never hand-maintained. Replaces the
// unenforced "≥3 positive / ≥3 negative cases" prose convention in CLAUDE.md
// with a measured, phase-scaled obligation.
//
// Spec: docs/design/verification-density-program.md (Phase 0).
//
// The core rule the counts serve: every distinguishable behavior of a detector
// needs a case in both directions. A flat count is a proxy for that; the real
// obligation is derived from the detector's own branch structure (Phase 3).
// Until branch data exists, `min_positive` / `min_negative` are the tier's
// stand-in floor — deliberately 1-per-direction at the advisory tier, because
// one case that covers the only branch is COMPLETE, not deficient.
