// Portable, per-mutant counterexample search: generate diverse inputs from the

// pristine and mutated module side by side, and diff the full observable output
// (return value + thrown error). A divergence KILLS the mutant with a minimized
// repro; the ABSENCE of a divergence after N runs is SEARCH EVIDENCE toward the
// mutant being unkillable — never a proof of equivalence (only `mutation accept`
// with a verifier-issued certificate may claim that — see disposition.ts).
//
// See docs/design/equivalent-mutant-handling.md ("Lever 3 — raise the
// equivalence-proof bar... some 'equivalents' are stubborn-but-killable... and
// `fast-check` kills a class example tests miss") and
// scratch/probes/mutant-shadow-runner.ts (the proven applyReplacement/
// buildMutant/import-both mechanism this module generalizes into a portable,
// type-driven engine that needs no per-target hand-written generator).
