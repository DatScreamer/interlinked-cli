// When an id occurrence counts as a DEFINITION rather than a reference.
//
// Definition credit drives `NamespaceId.defSites`, which the spec_numbering
// check reads to say "this id is defined twice" and to compute registry gaps.
// It used to be a pure line-SHAPE test: any heading / table row / list item /
// blockquote line credited its first id. Shape alone cannot tell a registry row
// from a sentence that merely happens to live inside one, so every later
// mention of a tier/stage name in a table cell or a numbered step read as a
// redefinition — measured on docs/plans/16-monotonic-quality-enforcement.md,
// where T1/T2 are defined once in §3 and referenced in later prose.
//
// The fix is POSITION: a definition names its subject at the HEAD of its site —
// the first table cell, the start of a list item, the start of a quoted or
// bold-leading line. Anything after a word of running text on that site is a
// reference. Headings are exempt from the head rule (a title defines its
// subject wherever the id sits: "### Detector D1 — Assertion Side Effects").
