 * file-system semantics:
 *
 * - `pure_read`       — observation only (no mutation, no network).
 * - `local_write`     — mutates state confined to this machine.
 * - `external_action` — escapes the machine (network, remote API, push,
 *                       deploy, publish, email, …).
 *
 * Mirrors the same union exported from
 * `src/harness/evaluator/tool-classifiers.ts`; declared here so
 * `GuardRule.tool_externality` can reference it without pulling in the
 * evaluator module (types/rules.ts is intentionally side-effect free).
